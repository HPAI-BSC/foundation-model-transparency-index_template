# foundation-model-transparency-index_template
Latex template for writting a thorough model card following the categories identified by Stanford's Foundation Model Transparency Index. The latex template includes sections, subsections and subsubsection for all 100 elements, together with their definition and "notes", a sort of recommendations on how to fill and assess each item.
